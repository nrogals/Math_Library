The MATH Library shown here will be a collection of various numerical algorithms that I have come across during my academic coursework and in my reading









The following provides an outline of the library that I would like to build using C++. The first goal of the library will be to try to provide automatic preconditioning. Preconditioning helps solve large linear systems iteratively, and as Trefethen mentions in his book "Numerical Linear Algebra", the name of th the ne:w game is preconditioning.

Preconditioning is difficult, yet imporant. The solving of linear systems is important to many engineering, physics and financial calculations. Preconditioning for the basis of many scientific calculations
