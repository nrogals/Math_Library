The following will house documentation or goals for the MATH Library that I will work to develop.



I think that the best method to build this library will be to work on first solving a series of 
different iterative systems iteratively.

From that experience, I will abstract the salient and relevant components to place into the library. 

The library will be built upon Eigen which a high performance easy to use linear algebra library.
